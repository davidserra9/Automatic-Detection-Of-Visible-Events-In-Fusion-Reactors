# Automatic Detection Of Visible Events In Fusion Reactors Using Deep Learning

This project done by David Serrano for his Final Bachelor Thesis consist in a system capable of detecting and classifying the visible events of Wendelstein 7-X, a experimental fusion reactor build by the IPP (Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics) which intends to demonstrate the capabilities of fusion power to produce energy.
